Online Shopping gives great power to people but it becomes headache to check all these websites and get product of our choice.
So we team Bluecode decided to make this easier by making an app for fashion products from all over the internet. We take some
inputs and save those as your preferences, then show you products based on that from all over the internet. We save your preferences
so that you don't have to input again.This will save time of user and show him/her personalised products.
