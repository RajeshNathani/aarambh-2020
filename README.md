Team Bluecode <br>
Online Shopping gives great power to people but it becomes headache to check all these websites and get product of our choice.
So we team Bluecode decided to make this easier by making an app for fashion products from all over the internet. We take some
inputs and save those as your preferences, then show you products based on that from all over the internet. We save your preferences
so that you don't have to input again.This will save time of user and show him/her personalised products.

## Technologies
1. Flask for apis(hosted on heroku)(https://fashionxapi.herokuapp.com/). <br>
For Frontend:
1. HTML/HTML5
2. CSS3 + UIKit Framework(https://getuikit.com/)
3. Javascript

## For compilation: <br>
Adobe Phonegap to create android and windows phone app(https://build.phonegap.com/apps/4036918/share).
App can be downloaded with the above link. This app is our main submission.
Since Phonegap requires a different repository one can find that out at(https://github.com/RajeshNathani/clothink) although the source code has been uploaded in this repo too.
